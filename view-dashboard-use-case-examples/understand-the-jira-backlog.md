You are interested in participating in a project, but first, you want to see if the project has an accumulation of uncompleted work that needs to be dealt with in the backlog.

**Do these steps:**

1. Click a **project name** on a project of interest that shows the Jira logo ![](../.gitbook/assets/7407349.png).
2. From the **Project Management** drop-down list, select **Jira** &gt; **Backlog**.  
   A dashboard focuses on open issues, their accumulated time, and associated organization:Jira &gt; Backlog

   **Open Issues Statistics** shows the total number of Open Issues, Accumulated Open Days, and the Average Time Open Days per Issue.

   **Backlog** shows a table that lets you sort values by Title, Info, Repository, Submitter, and Days Open. The default sort is by the greatest number of open days.

   **Issues waiting to be closed** shows a stacked bar graph that represents the number of issues that are not closed per day over time by status: Open or In Progress. Mouse over a color in the graph to see the total number of issues by status that occurred on a date.

   **Accumulated Time \(days\): Issues waiting to be closed** shows a bar graph that represents the number of issues by accumulated open days per day over time. Mouse over a color in the graph to see the accumulated number of days issues were waiting to be closed on a date.

   **Assignee Organizations** shows a doughnut chart that represents the total number of assignees in the project by organization. Mouse over a color in the chart to see the total number of assignees for the organization, and their percentage of the project's organization.

   **Backlog Submitters** shows a table that lets you sort values by Submitters, Issues, Avg. Time Open Days, and Repositories, which is the number of repositories per submitter.

   **Organizations** shows a table that lets you sort values by Organization, Issues, Avg. Time Open \(Days\), and Avg. Num. Watchers.

   **Repositories** shows a table that lets you sort values by Repository, Issues, and Avg. Time Open \(Days\).

3. View statistics about open issues in **Open Issues Statistics**. These statistics give you a summary of open issues in the backlog.
4. Look at the data in **Issues waiting to be closed** and **Accumulated Time \(days\): Issues waiting to be closed** to learn about the number of issues by status over time. ![](../.gitbook/assets/7407851.png) ![](../.gitbook/assets/7407852.png)
5. Find more information in the dashboard such as who the submitters are and the average days open of the issues that they submit. For example, you might notice a recurring pattern of issues that accumulate in a certain time frame.

This data can help you decide if this is a project in which you want to spend your time.
