Dev Analytics provides an _onion model analysis_. This analysis is defined by the number and identity of core, regular, and casual contributors. These are individuals who have done 80 percent, 15 percent, and 5 percent of the contributions to a project. Thus, the onion structure divides contributors into three groups:

* **Core**: People contributing **80 percent of the activity**. These people are the most committed developers and are those contributors on whom the project relies the most.
* **Regular**: People contributing the next **15 percent of the activity**. These are people who are committed to the project and may become part of the core group or perhaps already belonged to it. The core and regular groups together account for 95 percent of the activity.
* **Casual**: People contributing the last **5 percent of the activity**. These are people in the periphery of the project. However, these contributors are important because the future core and regular contributors may emerge from this group.

Free and Open Source Software \(FOSS\) development is software developed by informal collaborative networks of programmers. In FOSS development, employees usually start in a regular or core group, depending on their positions, experience and responsibilities in the company. Conversely, non-employees generally start as a part of the casual group and may become regular and core contributors as they gain experience about the project.

**Do these steps:**

1. Click a **project name** of interest.
2. From the **Community** drop-down list, select **Overall Community Structure**. from: [https://chaoss.github.io/grimoirelab-sigils/panels/community-structure/](https://chaoss.github.io/grimoirelab-sigils/panels/community-structure/) not sure if it appliesâ€“just a guess and placeholder. A dashboard appears and shows the following visualizations:
   * **Community Structure** shows a bar chart of the total numbers of casual, core, and regular people to the project over time.
   * **Contributions** shows a bar chart of the total number of contributions over time.
   * **Authors** shows a table of the total numbers of authors and the number of their contributions to the project for the first quarter and last quarter of the year.
   * **Roles** shows a table of the total numbers for each category: casual, core, and regular people, and the number of their contributions to the project for the first quarter and last quarter of the year.
3. Use the visualizations to understand the evolution of the different groups and their contributions over time. need an example here
4. Onion metric is calculated with different levels of granularity:
   * Globally: takes all data into account.
   * By organization: splits data by organization.
   * By project: split data by project.
   * By organization and project: splits data by organization and project.
