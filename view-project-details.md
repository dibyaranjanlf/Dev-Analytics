**Follow these steps:**

1. Go to [https://lfanalytics.io](https://lfanalytics.io/). The Projects page appears and lists the projects to which you have access.
2. Navigate to a project card on the page . Each project card shows the following information:
   * Project name identifies the project by name.
   * Description briefly describes the project. When a project description shows only an excerpt, click the **excerpt** to see the entire description.
   * **Contributors** shows the total number of contributors to the project.
   * **Contributions** shows the total number of contributions to the project. A stacked area chart compares the number of contributors and contributions over time. ![](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/download/attachments/7409465/DA%20project%20stacked%20area%20chart.png?version=1&modificationDate=1566927060964&api=v2)  Some or all of the following information displays depending on what data is available:
     * **Projects** ![](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/download/thumbnails/7409465/DA%20project_logos.png?version=1&modificationDate=1566927060999&api=v2)shows the logos for foundation member projects.
     * **Project Management** shows the logos of the data sources such as GitHub ![](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/download/thumbnails/7409465/github-01.png?version=1&modificationDate=1566927061057&api=v2), Jira ![](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/download/thumbnails/7409465/jira-01.png?version=1&modificationDate=1566927061094&api=v2), or Slack ![](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/download/thumbnails/7409465/slack-01.png?version=1&modificationDate=1566927061123&api=v2).
     * Labels ![](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/download/attachments/7409465/DA%20project%20label.png?version=1&modificationDate=1566927061148&api=v2) identify the project repository subjects.
     * An icon ![](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/download/thumbnails/7409465/DA%20CNCF%20maturity%20icon.png?version=1&modificationDate=1566927061190&api=v2) on each Cloud Native Computing Foundation \(CNCF\) project indicates its [maturity stages](https://www.cncf.io/projects/): sandbox, incubating, or graduated.
3. Select a **project** of interest:
   * A foundation member project shows sub-projects. Select a **sub-project**. A page shows overviews.
   * A nonmember project shows a page with overviews.
4. Go to each overview. Overviews are dashboards that show important data. These overview dashboards are collection of charts and graphs that show you the metrics. The overview dashboards let you monitor many metrics at once, so you can check the health of your projects and see how the contribution is. For details, see [Code &gt; General](view-dashboard-catalog-of-a-project/code/general.md).
5. Use optional actions:
   * [Pick a Time Range](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/display/PROD/.Pick+a+Time+Range+vInitial)
   * Eliminate data by clicking the corresponding legend **caption** \(in this example **Contributors\)**. Click the **caption** again to include the data. ![](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/download/thumbnails/7409465/contributor%20button.png?version=1&modificationDate=1575268704799&api=v2) 
   * Mouse over a color in a chart or graph to see details about the item.  ![](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/download/thumbnails/7409465/graph.png?version=1&modificationDate=1575268902646&api=v2)  ![](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/download/thumbnails/7409465/chart.png?version=1&modificationDate=1575268933415&api=v2)
