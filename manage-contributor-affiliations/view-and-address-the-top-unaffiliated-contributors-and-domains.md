# View and Address the Top Unaffiliated Contributors and Domains testing

This is ---- Top Unaffiliated Contributors and Top Unaffiliated Domains list the top-ten respective items with the greatest numbers of contributions that have no affiliation. Addressing missing affiliations produces meaningful statistics about your contributors and domains because individual contributions are not underestimated. Different roles \(examples: organization representatives, individual contributors, or community managers\) might recognize that contribution counts seem underestimated or inaccurate. These roles can take action by addressing missing affiliations.
