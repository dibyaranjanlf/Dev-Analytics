# Unmerge a Profile Identity

Each unique identity has a profile that summarizes user data. The profile can be affiliated to more than one identity and you can unmerge \(remove\) an identity from a profile.

The unmerge action is only available when a profile has multiple identities.

**Do these steps:**

1. Select a **project name** of interest.
2. Select **Identity Management**.
3. Select **Profiles** from the menu ![](../.gitbook/assets/7410032.png).
4. Click a **row** that corresponds to a name of interest that has a **\#** count greater than 1. Profile Information appears.
5. Go to **Profile Identities**. The profile identities are listed. Each identity shows Name, E-mail, Username, and Source.
6. Find the name you want to unmerge and click **Unmerge** on the row.
7. Click **Unmerge** on the Confirm dialog that appears. The identity is not listed in Profile Identities.
