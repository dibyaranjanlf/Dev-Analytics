The Jenkins dashboards are available from the **Technical Management** drop-down list.

### Jenkins &gt; Overview

**Agnies to check as the below mentioned points are not matching with UI**

SUMMARY: Overview shows an overview of Jenkins build and job data over time.

**Summary** shows the number of builds, jobs, nodes, and average build duration in minutes.

**Results** shows a doughnut chart that represents the total number of builds in the project by status: SUCCESS, FAILURE, UNSTABLE, ABORTED. Mouse over a color in the chart to see the status, total number of builds for the status, and the percentage of the project's builds for that status.

**Nodes** show a table of nodes, which are machines that are part of your Jenkins environment. For each node, the table shows the node name, number of builds on the node, the 50th percentile of builds duration in minutes, and builds duration in minutes.

**Builds over time** shows a bar graph that represents the number of builds per day over time.

**Active nodes over time** shows a bar graph that represents the number of active nodes per day over time.

**Builds** shows a table of the number of builds, 50th percentile of build duration in minutes, builds duration, success, and failures. The 50th percentile number indicates the median number of minutes that builds took to complete. This number indicates that 50 percent of the builds took longer than that number and 50 percent of the builds took less time that number. A 50th percentile is the same as a median.

### Jenkins &gt; Jobs 

**Agnies to review as the below mentioned points are not matching with UI**

SUMMARY: Jobs shows data about Jenkins jobs such as duration, successes, and failures over time.

**Summary** shows the number of builds, jobs, nodes, and average build duration in minutes.

**Results** shows a doughnut chart that represents the total number of jobs in the project by status: SUCCESS, FAILURE, UNSTABLE, ABORTED. Mouse over a color in the chart to see the status, total number of jobs for the status, and the percentage of the project's jobs for that status.

**Jobs** shows a bar graph that represents the number of jobs per day over time.

**Duration Trend** shows the time in minutes for the total number of jobs per day over time and a trend line to show an increase, decrease, or stability in the job time.

**Jobs** shows a table that lets you sort values by the number of builds, 50th percentile of build duration in minutes, builds duration, success, and failures. The 50th percentile number indicates the median number of minutes that builds took to complete. This number indicates that 50 percent of the builds took longer than that number and 50 percent of the builds took less time that number. A 50th percentile is the same as a median.

**Success/Failures in percentage** shows a bar graph with each value as a percentage of the total count of jobs per day over time. Mouse over Success or Failures to show the corresponding data in the graph.

**Nodes** show a table of nodes, which are machines in your Jenkins environment. For each node, the table shows the node name, \# Builds, 50th percentile of Builds duration \(median, min.\), Builds duration \(total, min.\), Success, and Failures.

### Jenkins &gt; Nodes

SUMMARY: Nodes shows an overview of Jenkins build and job data over time.

**Summary** shows the number of builds, jobs, nodes, and average build duration in minutes.

**Results** shows a doughnut chart that represents the total number of builds in the project by status: SUCCESS, FAILURE, UNSTABLE, ABORTED. Mouse over a color in the chart to see the status, total number of builds for the status, and the percentage of the project's builds for that status.

**Jobs** shows a bar graph that represents the total number of job per day over a timeline.

**Duration Trend** shows the time in minutes for the total number of jobs per day over time and a trend line to show an increase, decrease, or stability in the job time.

**Success/Failures in percentage** shows a bar graph with each value as a percentage of the total count of jobs per day over time. Mouse over Success or Failures to show the corresponding data in the graph.

**Nodes** show a table of nodes, which are machines that are part of your Jenkins environment. For each node, the table shows the node name, number of builds on the node, the 50th percentile of builds duration in minutes, and builds duration in minutes.
