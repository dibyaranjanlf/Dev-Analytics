Where

The GitHub dashboards are available from the **Project Management** drop-down list.

### GitHub &gt; **Overview**

SUMMARY: Overview shows information about issues in project repositories and who submitted the issues and when. For each commit, information about the corresponding organization is also provided. 

**Issues** shows the total number of Issues, Submitters, and Repositories for the project.

**issues by Status, over time** shows a stacked bar graph that represents the number of open and closed issues over time.

**Submitters, over time** shows a bar graph of the number of issue submitters of issues over time.

**Submitters** shows a table that lets you sort values by Submitter, Issues, Repositories, and Avg. Open Days. 

**Submitters by Organization** shows a doughnut chart that represents the total number of submitters by each organization. Mouse over a color \(organization\) in the chart to see the organization name, total number of submitters, and the percentage of the project's submitters.

**Projects** shows a table that lets you sort values by Project, Issues Open, Submitters, and Repositories. 

**issues by Organization, over time** shows a stacked bar graph that represents the number of issues by organization over time.

**Organizations** shows a table that lets you sort values by Organization, Issues Open, Submitters, Assignees, and Labels. 

**Repositories** lists the project's repositories. This table shows the total \# Issues Open, \# Submitters, \# Assignees, and \# Labels per repository. You can select a repository to view its details in GitHub.

### GitHub &gt; **Backlog**

SUMMARY: Backlog focuses on open issues \(data is retrieved at the moment of dashboard creation\), their accumulated time, and associated organization.

**Open Issues Statistics** shows the total number of Open Issues, Accumulated Open Days, and Average Time Open per Issue.

**Backlog \(Open Issues\)** shows a table that lets you sort values by Summary, URL, Open Date, and Days Open. Click a URL to go to the issue in the project.

**Backlog** shows a bar graph of the number of issues by open days over time.

**Backlog: Issues \(Accumulated Time\)** shows a bar graph that represents the number of issues by accumulated open days over time.

**Organizations** shows a doughnut chart that represents the total number of issues in the project by organization. Mouse over a color in the chart to see the total number of issues for the organization, and their percentage of the project's organization.

**Backlog Submitters** shows a table that lets you sort values by Submitters, Issues, Avg. Time Open \(Days\), and Repositories.

**Organizations** shows a table that lets you sort values by Organization, Issues open, Submitters, Assignees, and Labels.

**Projects** shows a table that lets you sort values by Project, Issues Open, Submitters, and Repositories.

### GitHub &gt; **Efficiency**

SUMMARY: Efficiency offers a view of efficiency closing issues based on metrics: Backlog Management Index \(BMI\), Lead Time, and Time to Close.

**Efficiency Closing GitHub Issues** lets you select and organization and project as values for the dashboard data.

**BMI** shows a multi-line graph that represents the Backlog Management Index \(BMI\). BMI is the number of closed issues divided by the number of open ones in a given period of time. Moving Avg. is set to 8 weeks to identify changes in trends. Average is also shown as a reference. BMI values greater than 1 mean the community is closing more issues than those they are opening. Values less than 1 mean the oppositeâ€”more issues are open than those closed during a given time frame. Mouse over this graph or **Lead Time** to show a line that displays the date and time at the top of the legend..

**Lead Time** shows a multi-line graph that represents the Average Time to Close issues expressed in days and what the trend is. This graph helps you to identify peaks and visualize the time spent in closing issues.

**Time to Close** shows a gauge that represents the time from issue creation to the moment in which it is closed. The gauge is set to show green color for less than 7 days, yellow for values from 7 to 30 days, and red from 30 to 90 days. This color scheme means that a week is considered as a good time to close. The color scheme is just a visual reference and you can always rely on the number, ignoring this color scheme.

**Repositories** shows a table that lets you sort values by Repository and 50th percentile of Median Time Open \(days\).

### GitHub &gt; Timing

SUMMARY: Timing shows information about open and closed issues in time. The dashboard shows submitters, repositories and organizations, but focuses on how long Issues remain open. Statistical information provides closing times and also tables with the latest and the oldest Issues.

**Summary** shows the total number of Issues, Submitters, Assignees, and 50th percentile of Median Time Open \(Days\).

**Median Open Time \(days\)** shows a bar graph of the median number of issues that were created per day overtime.

**80 Percent Open Time \(days\)** shows a bar graph of the 80th percentile number of issues that were created per day overtime.

**Status** shows a doughnut chart that represents the total number of issues in the project by status: closed or open. Mouse over a color in the chart to see the status, the total number of issues for the status, and the percentage of the project's issues for that status.

**Issues by Organization** shows a doughnut chart that represents the total number of issues in the project by organization. Mouse over a color in the chart to see the total number of issues for the organization, and their percentage of the project's organization.

**Issues** shows a stacked bar graph that represents the total number of issues over time in the project by status: closed or open. Mouse over a color in the graph to see the status, the total number of issue for the status, and the date.

**Submitters** shows a bar graph that represents the total number of submitters over time in the project. Mouse over a color in the graph to see the status, total number of submitters and the date.
